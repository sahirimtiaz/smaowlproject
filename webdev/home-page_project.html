		<h3>Why is he my favorite player?</h3>
		<p>Virat Kohli is my favorite player because he has a amazing talent in batting and in my opinion he is the best bat's man that I know of.
		But Virat Kohli is arguably better than all the batsman.
		Kohli is cricket's latest superstar.
		Some of the numerous records to his name are: best ODI average ever (minimum 50 innings), 
		second most centuries (41), fastest to 8000, 9000 and 10,000 runs, and the most 50-plus scores in T20I cricket (21).</p>
